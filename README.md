> [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) codebase containing real world examples (CRUD, auth, advanced patterns, etc) that adheres to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) spec and API.


### [Demo](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged application built with **[Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp)** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **[RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)** community styleguides & best practices.  
For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
